- Dictates what should happen when a certain function is performed
- Triggers need to be created in the command line


CREATE TABLE test(
    message VARCHAR(100)
);


DELIMITER $$
CREATE 
    TRIGGER my_trigger BEFORE INSERT
    ON employee
    FOR EACH ROW BEGIN
        INSERT INTO test VALUES("added new employee");
    END$$
DELIMITER ;
- This creates a trigger so that before anything is inserted into employee table, "added new employee" is inserted to test
- DELIMITER $$ changes the ; to $$, allowing a statement to be put in to the trigger 
- DELIMITER ; changes it back
