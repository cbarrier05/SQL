- Combine rows from 2 or more tables based on a related column


SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.emp_name, branch.branch_name
FROM employee
JOIN branch
ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id;
- Combines  emp_id, emp_name and branch_name
- when an emp_id and mgr_id match up
- So only managers are returned with emp_id, emp_name and branch_name


SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.emp_name, branch.branch_name
FROM employee
LEFT JOIN branch
ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id;
- LEFT JOIN include all rows from employee table
- But only emp_id that appear in mgr_id have branch)name attached, not the rest 


SELECT employee.emp_id, employee.emp_name, branch.branch_name
FROM employee
RIGHT JOIN branch
ON employee.emp_id = branch.mgr_id;
- RIGHT JOIN includes all rows from branch and only ones from employee when emp_id match up with mgr_id
